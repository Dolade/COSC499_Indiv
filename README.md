 Individual exercise pertaining to array sorting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two array sorting features have been implemented using Java code.
- Integer array sorting (ascending order)
- String array sorting (ascending order in relevance to string length/amount of characters)



Both version have been split into their own respective branches.



Integer version:
- Numbers are randomly generated from 0 - 100, then sorted accordingly


String version:
- User inputs 5 of their own strings user a scanner, then it is sorted accordingly
